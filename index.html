                <p class="tabsText">Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding
                    winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of
                    the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern
                    Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal)
                    equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and
                    nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the Summer Solstice in June (Northern
                    Hemisphere) and December (Southern Hemisphere).</p>

                <p class="tabsText">Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates. It occurs
                    after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a
                    hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of
                    winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

                <p class="tabsText">Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and
                    before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs,
                    daylight hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season
                    progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate,
                    tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern
                    Hemisphere, and vice versa.
